        <p>As of right now, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve updated TRATATE<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which was mostly due to school and a general loss of interest. I&rsquo;ve come full circle funnily enough, thinking about how to effectively manage tasks again and failing to find a tool that fits my specific needs. What are those needs? Currently, it&rsquo;s only one: I&rsquo;d like a program that is awfully simple to use, but under the hood takes into consideration user preferences and past task completion data to make a proper schedule&hellip; Okay, well maybe more than one but the gist of what it should do is presented here.</p>
<p>I intend make the first version of this idea sometime during the summer. However, what should I even include/leave out? The current classes that represent tasks are a bit&hellip; ambiguous (i.e. I relied heavily on <code>*args</code> for the parameters and thus made the class a bit weird/hard to understand). So, <em>refactoring OOP structure</em> is one of my main priorities. Also, I don&rsquo;t need fancy visuals (may or may not come later) as of yet&ndash;yes that means <em>getting rid of that strange Tkinter graph output</em>. Also I should really <em>make adding tasks a lot easier</em> since I&rsquo;m aiming to create a simple-to-use but functional program. NLP? Sounds like a stretch, but could be a great inspiration for the feature.</p>
<p>Moreover, I hope this new direction of this project will utilize ML in some way to <em>optimize the schedule</em> (i.e. simply tasks to focus on for the day). Couple that with <em>assignment types</em> like essay, review guide, or pset, each with a specified importance metric, and thus implying a <em>new priority score</em>, and we would have a base to work on. Other impactful features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider busy periods (e.g. exams, rest days)</li>
<li>consider past data (e.g. completing a task won&rsquo;t entirely change the schedule to avoid overwork/stress)</li>
<li>optimization algorithms. I already have that knapsack algorithm for maximizing the priority and minimizing the total time spent working. how about we can do:
<ul>
<li>maximizing free time, minimizing tardiness</li>
<li>maximizing number of tasks, minimizing difficulty</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>task dependencies -&gt; maximize chain length, minimize tardiness/minimizing time worked</li>
<li>all of these can be preferences set by the user. e.g.:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Free as a bird&rdquo; -&gt; generates the schedule giving you the most free time while still tackling larger assignments; downside is, you may be working up to the deadline</li>
<li>&ldquo;Early bird gets the worm&rdquo; -&gt; tardiness will not be tolerated, no matter what</li>
<li>&ldquo;Frogs in the morning??&rdquo; -&gt; tasks with the highest difficulty are thrown at ya!</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am speed&rdquo; -&gt; lower the difficulty but maximize the number of completed tasks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas may obviously change, but everything mentioned, if synthesized into one product, may be what people want to see in a task manager: not a place to drop your tasks in a list, left only to be indefinitely dragged around every day, but as something you can count on to manage your tasks.</p>
